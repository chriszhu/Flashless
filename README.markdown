Flashless
=========

[Download Flashless 1.1](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/useless/Flashless/Flashless.1.1.zip) (Universal Binary, 24K).

Flashless is a Cocoa WebKit plug-in that blocks Flash content until you click on it. Requires Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.

It also displays a preview image and permits direct downloading of video files for some services.

Currently supported are:

* **YouTube** (preview, download only when viewing on [youtube.com](http://youtube.com/))
* **XTube** (preview, download)
* **Viddler** (preview)

If direct downloading is supported, an downward arrow will be displayed in the lower left corner. In this case you can choose _Download Video_ from the contextual menu or just click the plug-in area with the alternate key pressed.

This project is somewhat based on **ClickToFlash** (https://github.com/rentzsch/clicktoflash).
